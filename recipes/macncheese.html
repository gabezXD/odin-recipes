      <p>
        i love this recipe because it's taken me so long to actually get a good
        tasting noodle and not just a good tasting piece of cheese on top. this
        recipe was just trial and error and it's really really good in my
        opinion, the cheese remelts and the flavor really sets in. enjoy!
